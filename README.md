This document is still a stub.

Lua Utility eXTension is a Lua-only library compatible with Lua 5.1 through
Lua 5.3 which provides a handful of features for everyday Lua programming that
cannot be found in the standard library of the language. Features included are:

+ A prototype-based Object Oriented system
+ A class-based Object Oriented system
+ A functional programming module
+ An unit test module
+ A macro processor feature

## Installation

Basically put the the lib/lux folder into your lua path. We'll eventually make a
luarock for this library.
